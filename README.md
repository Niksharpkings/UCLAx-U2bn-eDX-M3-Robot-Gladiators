**Title: Initial game functionality - MVP**

*Description:*
###### Must Have:
> - Build a game where a player's robot can fight another robot until one of them loses.
> - If the enemy-robot loses first, the player's robot will move on to fight another enemy-robot.

###### Features:

> - The player's robot's name can be dynamically created by the player through the browser.
> - The player is given the option to skip the fight by paying a penalty fee, or continue with the fight.

**Title: Add shop functionality:**
> - After defeating an enemy, ask the player if they would like to purchase an item from a store.
> - The player can purchase health or attack points if they can afford it.
  Title: Add randomness to health and damage values

*Description:*
> - Start enemies at a random health value between 40 and 60.
> - Start enemies with a random attack value between 10 and 14.
> - Attack damage is random, using the robot's attack value as an upper limit (for example, if the player's attack is 10, their damage range is 7-10).
**Title: Restructure data with JS objects:**
*Description:*
> - Create and use JavaScript objects to organize data related to the player and data related to the enemies.
> - Create object methods to perform player actions.
